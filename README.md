# Schedulr

## Database Initialization

Before using the application, make sure to initialize the classroom data:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Run the classroom initialization script
node scripts/initClassrooms.js

# You can check if classrooms are properly initialized with:
node scripts/checkClassrooms.js
```

This will populate the database with classroom data required for the scheduling system.
